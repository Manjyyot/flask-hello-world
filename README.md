API Endpoints

The Flask Hello World API provides several endpoints that allow users to interact with the application. Below are the details of the available API endpoints, including descriptions and example responses.

Overview of Endpoints

Endpoint

HTTP Method

Description

/

GET

Returns a simple "Hello, World!" message.

/hello

GET

Returns a greeting message without a name.

/hello/<name>

GET

Returns a personalized greeting for the given name.

Root Endpoint (/)

The root endpoint is the most basic endpoint of the API. When a GET request is made to this endpoint, it returns a JSON response with the message "Hello, World!".

Request:

GET /


Example Response:

{
  "message": "Hello, World!"
}


This endpoint serves as a straightforward introduction to how routing works in Flask. It is a great starting point for developers to understand how to set up routes and return simple JSON responses.

Hello Endpoint (/hello)

The Hello endpoint provides a generic greeting. It is designed to return a welcoming message without requiring any input parameters. This endpoint showcases how to define a route in Flask that doesn't need any additional information from the user.

Request:

GET /hello


Example Response:

{
  "message": "Hello!"
}


This response confirms that the API is functioning correctly and illustrates how Flask can handle requests at different routes.

Dynamic Hello Name Endpoint (/hello/<name>)

The Dynamic Hello Name endpoint is where the API truly demonstrates its capability for personalization. By accepting a name as a URL parameter, this endpoint generates a customized greeting.

Request:

GET /hello/John


Example Response:

{
  "message": "Hello, John!"
}


In this example, if the user replaces "John" with any other name, the API will respond with a greeting tailored to that name. This feature is particularly important as it shows how Flask can process dynamic URL parameters and provide tailored outputs based on user input.

Summary of API Endpoints

The Flask Hello World API consists of three primary endpoints. Each endpoint provides unique functionality, from returning a static message to generating personalized greetings. These endpoints serve as excellent examples for developers to learn how to create and manage routes in a Flask application, as well as how to handle user input effectively.
